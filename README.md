# naive-bayes-algorithm
## Project Overview
This project implements a Naïve Bayes algorithm to classify emails as spam or not spam based on three key features extracted from email content. It is based on Bayes’ Theorem and assumes feature independence.
## Limitation
Assumes features are independent, which may not always hold for email data.
